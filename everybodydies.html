  Everybody Dies by Jim Munroe is a texted based adventure you download and can play on your computer. Each stage is a bit of a mystery because based on the scenario you have to figure out which commands will do something useful and interesting. Generally you are able to move with “go”, look around with “look” and grab objects with “take”. Throughout the game the user will control multiple characters and experience a brief snippet of each of their lives, the very end portion. Yet the game does not end upon the death of any character, after a brief waiting time  the player inhabits another employee of Cost Cutters. Allowing users to control the characters with text entry makes them feel as if they are really a part of the story, rather than just an onlooker. Especially at first, it is very possible to believe the commands a reader enters could actually change the outcome of the narrative. Maybe if the user chooses to go east, instead of  heading in any other direction, the character could actually be saved. However, the more time spent playing a run through of Everybody Dies, and especially upon multiple times playing, this illusion of control starts to fall apart. There is only ever one command which will actually make the story move forward, and it can be very difficult to figure out exactly what that command is. While this struggle to find the command can certainly be infuriating, it can be oddly constructive as well. Rather than just blindly following the story, the user has to think through all the different choices a character could make and why they would or would not work in the scenario. Going through this process makes sitting and pondering what to do for 15 minutes not just tolerable, but oddly enjoyable. So while this text entry may not allow a user to actually change the outcome of the story, it does make sure they are actively engaging with the narrative and really thinking about it.
