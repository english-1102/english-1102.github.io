Electronic literature takes many forms in order to convey its purpose. While some contain complex navigational structures such as clicking through images and travelling through a story as an animated character, others utilize simple yet direct navigational structures such as hypertext to describe a story or a message on an equivalent scale. Twelve Blue by Michael Joyce exemplifies the latter, simplified portrayal of significance. The more notable aspect of this particular electronic piece is its interactivity and its ability to allow the readers to contribute to its meaning. Even with the literatureâ€™s restriction on  the amount of overall control, the illusion of any control through the hypertext and images, allow the readers to stay engaged, for their mouse clicks results on a different outcome each time.

Here, Twelve Blue tells a very complex story about life events including but not limited to love affairs, drowning, friendship, and murder. The electronic literature utilizes hypertext and images to convey and continue the story. Sometimes, hypertext is embedded within a section of text. However, often, when there is not, one can navigate by clicking on different sections of the rectangle on the left. Overall, the author allows the reader to take control, however he does not complete control. Illusion of control is evident, for the reader only has a certain number of links to choose from. Within the body of text, only one hypertext is embedded. While this is true, the reader has the choice to change the story drastically by clicking on a random section of the left-hand rectangle. The ability to change one or more aspects of the story allows the readers to feel like they have power and are engaged until the very end.
