  Interactivity within a piece harnesses two innate human characteristics in order to make the reader more involved: curiosity, and short attention spans. By nature, humans are constantly curious and do not actually need to be given separate endings in order to be left wondering “what if” or what would have happened had they chosen a different option somewhere along the line. By keeping the reader constantly wondering about these supposedly different paths they could have taken, authors of electronic literature capitalize upon short attention spans. Especially in this day and age, readers are constantly assaulted by different notifications and pop ups vying for their attention, and as suggested by Sally J. McMillan, and Jang-Sun Hwang, readers are [expected] to engage with the the Web rather than simply be exposed to it (39).The different onscreen actions a user must take in order to progress the story forward make sure readers are involved with piece by forcing them to put themselves in the character’s shoes as they make decisions.

    Even something as simple as hyperlinks, the original form of interaction with electronic literature, can be surprisingly effective, such as those seen in Twelve Blue by Michael Joyce. Hypertext can be defined as when "the author presents a text with a certain number of built-in links, which, when selected, take the reader to a different node of what is in effect a global textual network, for the selected link may lead to the next paragraph or to a document stored on the other side of the world" (Chaouli 602). These hyperlinks break the story down into shorter and more digestible chunks. Each time a user encounters a hyperlink it serves as a check in point that they are still engaged with the piece. Hyperlinks also offer no visual representation of where they are taking a reader, which engages the aforementioned curiosity of readers. When a reader flips a page in a traditional piece of literature they know they are going directly to the very next part of the story. Conversely, a hyperlink could literally take the reader anywhere on the internet. This means the reader must first take stock of where they end up and think critically about how it relates to where they were, then, they will still be left wondering where else they could have ended up because they have no true way of knowing unless they go back and try it. While simple hyperlinks are effective, involvement can be further enhanced through the use of more advanced interactive methodologies which modern day technology affords.

  	Text entry as well as the incorporation of video and buttons allow the user to feel even more like they are a part of the story, therefore increasing involvement. In “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch”, the viewer controls the main character Stefan through choosing different options for him. Whenever the user makes a choice, the result can quickly be seen taking effect on Stefan. While the visuals certainly help increase involvement over traditional print literature because humans are naturally wired to respond empathetically to pain, happiness, et cetera, the greatest emotional involvement comes from the fact that the user feels responsible for creating whichever emotion is seen. Therefore, whenever Stefan fails or the movie is reset to a previous decision the user is left with the nagging curiosity of why: which choice caused this? This forces the user to think about the plot and what they could have done do differently. According to Netflix, this is intentional--“If bad things happen, you’ll feel even more crestfallen, because you were responsible. If the character is victorious, you’ll feel even more uplifted because you made that choice (Streitfeld).” Users are invested. Subsequently, a user will try different options and
