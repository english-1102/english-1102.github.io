  Interactivity within a piece harnesses two innate human characteristics in order to make the reader more involved: <a href="intro6.html"> curiosity </a>, and short attention spans. By nature, humans are constantly curious and do not actually need to be given separate endings in order to be left wondering what if. They will always want to know what would have happened had they chosen a different option somewhere along the line. By keeping the reader constantly wondering about these supposedly different paths they could have taken, authors of electronic literature capitalize upon short attention spans. Especially in this day and age, readers are constantly assaulted by different notifications and pop ups vying for their attention, and as suggested by Sally J. McMillan, and Jang-Sun Hwang, readers are “[expected] to engage with the the Web rather than simply be exposed to it” (39). Static and unengaging text will inevitably be ignored in favor of interactive pop ups and distractions. The different onscreen actions a user must take in order to progress the story forward make sure readers are <a href = "intro5.html> involved </a> with the piece by forcing them to put themselves in the character’s shoes as they make decisions.
