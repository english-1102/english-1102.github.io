  Kate Pullinger’s Inanimate Alice tells the story of an 8-year old girl in 21st century China searching for her lost father. Through pictures, music, animations, and text, the story walks viewers through Alice’s life: her hobbies, home, family, and brings viewers along for the ride when her father goes missing. As the story progresses, players slowly learn slightly ominous details about the situation. Her father works for an oil company, raising the question of whether he kidnapped. Alice’s mother is shown driving very fast at night through a desert, bringing up the suspicion they are running away. Alice’s parents tell her to turn her phone off, so maybe they are they being tracked. None of these details are fully resolved, because they are all learned through Alice’s relatively innocent eyes.

  There are many narrative elements to unpack here, but the interactive elements of the piece are particularly impactful. In order to advance the plot, the reader must click on an arrow. This gives the audience a sense of agency in the story. Although no actual decisions are being made, it makes the reader feel as if they have some control over what happens.

  However, when Alice’s mother tells her to turn off her phone in the middle of the night as they are searching for her father, the interactivity stops, and readers lose that feeling of control. The story advances on its own, and viewers are left to watch it unfold. Alice’s helplessness in that moment is coupled perfectly with the reader’s lack of control. This mirrored situation lets viewers empathize with Alice far more. People not only see that Alice is scared and helpless, but also feel that helplessness themselves. In this way, Inanimate Alice masterfully uses of interactivity as a genuine literary element that makes readers feel more involved in the story.
