Text entry as well as the incorporation of video and buttons allow the user to feel even more like they are a part of the story, therefore increasing <a href = "intro8.html"> involvement </a>. These can be seen working in “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch” and “Everybody Dies”. In “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch”, the viewer controls Stefan, a young programmer, through choosing different options for him. In “Everybody Dies” the user controls multiple employees of the store Cost Cutters, progressing to a new one when inevitably, everybody dies. Whenever the user makes a choice, the result can quickly be seen taking effect on all the characters.. While the visuals certainly help increase involvement over traditional print literature because humans are naturally wired to respond empathetically to pain, happiness, et cetera, the greatest emotional <a href = "intro8.html"> involvement </a> comes from the fact that the user feels responsible for creating whichever emotion is seen. Therefore, whenever Stefan fails, the movie is reset to a previous decision, or a character dies, the user is left with the nagging curiosity of why: which choice caused this? This forces the user to think about the plot and what they could have done do differently. According to Netflix, this is intentional--“If bad things happen, you will feel even more crestfallen, because you were responsible. If the character is victorious, you will feel even more uplifted because you made that choice (Streitfeld 1).” Users are <a href = "intro8.html"> invested </a>. Subsequently, a user will try different options and <a href = "intro8.html"> engage </a> with a piece far longer than they would with traditional literature because they feel a <a href = "intro2.html"> sense of control </a> and do not want to fail by means of the protagonist failing.  </p>
