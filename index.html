    <h1>Curiosity and Short Attention Spans: What Interactivity in Electronic Literature Tells Us</h1>

    <p>
 Since the 1980s, interactivity has permeated all corners of digital culture from hyperlinks to first-person video games. As the affordances of computers evolved to incorporate greater levels of technical complexity, interactivity also took on new, distinct forms to engage users of the vast web. Posting pictures and expressing emotions through short forms of text on social media platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter define peoples’ primary forms of interaction. Involvement with digital medium grew through the introduction of electronic literature, “[a first-generation digital object] that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (Hayles 198). In other words, similar to hard-copy novels, a story is conveyed; however, the stark differences lies in how the journey is navigated. Electronic literature utilizes various navigational structures including hypertext, images, videos, text input, and touch through mouse-clicks to increase the user’s interaction with a piece. As mentioned by Jessica Pressman, navigating electronic literature is an act of producing a work’s signifying properties in the moment of engagement with them (1). Thus,<a href="intro4.html"> interactivity <a/> involves the user within a story, allowing them to contribute to the <a href="intro2.html"> meaning </a> of the piece by giving them the feeling that they have <a href="index2.html"> control </a> over the outcome.
