Since the 1980s, interactivity has permeated all corners of digital culture from hyperlinks to first-person video games. As the affordances of computers evolved to incorporate greater levels of technical complexity, interactivity also took on new, distinct forms to engage users of the vast web. Posting pictures and expressing emotions through short forms of text on social media platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter define our primary forms of interaction. However, it must be noted that the involvement with digital medium can be dated back to the introduction of electronic literature, “[a first-generation digital object] that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (Hayles 1). In other words, similar to hard-copy novels, a story is conveyed; however, the stark differences lies in how the journey is navigated. Electronic literature utilizes various navigational structures including hypertext, images, videos, text input, and touch through mouse-clicks to increase the user’s interaction with a piece.
