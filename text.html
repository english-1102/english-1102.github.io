              <h3><a href="text.html">Bandersnatch</a></h3>
              <p class="post__intro">
              “Sugar Puffs or Frosties? What’s it gonna be?”
In “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch,” a choose-your-own-adventure film set in the 80’s in which the viewer controls the actions of the main character, a video game designer and programmer named Stefan. Some of the choices seem pointless, like the morning’s breakfast cereal. Some are life altering, like deciding whether Stefan will murder his father or stand down. In the grand scheme of the game of Stefan’s life, the viewer has no clue which decisions will affect him in the long run or how the decisions will affect him. </p>
<p class="post__intro">
While classified as a film, “Bandersnatch” is a piece of electronic literature. The film is born from the same idea as a much more simplistic hyperlink piece of electronic literature. In both, the viewer decides the outcome without knowing how the story will play out. The viewer is electronically engaged, but the limited outcomes parallels classic electronic literature. The story is decided by the viewer and can only be “read” or played out on a computer, unlike a normal movie.
There are five “main” endings to “Bandersnatch.” An ending occurs when the credits rolls. For this reason, there are also “wrong” answers resulting in dead ends and Stefan goes back in time. Stefan is programming the choose-your-own-adventure videogame Bandersnatch, and his madness through self-awareness of the fact that he is being controlled equivalents to how deep he is into the game’s program.
</p>
<p class="post__intro">
The viewer is put in an odd position in which they are controlling Stefan while Stefan is becoming more aware of his own fate and controlled destiny. It raises questions about technology and mental health and the scope of an individual’s free will. Controlling Stefan makes the viewer root for him. You want him to succeed, you want his Bandersnatch game to be a success and you want his mental health not to consume him. You want to make the right decisions. Humans naturally feel empathy towards others, and the empathy is even stronger when you control the individual’s destiny. So when Stefan succumbs to failure, suicide, drugs or murder, it just does not sit well as the gameplayer.
<p class="post__intro">
As the viewer, there is one thought running through your head: Why?

</p>
<p class="post__intro">
Because the traverse of Bandersnatch is more significant than the endings. The significance (or insignificance) of each decision and the descent into madness is notably conveyed through the medium. The movie format, rather than a hyperlink or animated video game allows the viewer to feel guilt and empathy with Stefan and his life. However, the medium limits the possible outcomes. Often times the viewer goes down a “wrong” path and is forced to return to a previous decision until an unsatisfying “ending” rolls. The looping makes it feel like more of a game than a true controllable journey.

              <h3><a href="text.html">Inanimate Alice</a></h3>
              <p class="post__intro"> Kate Pullinger’s Inanimate Alice tells the story of an 8-year old girl in 21st century China searching for her lost father. Through pictures, music, animations, and text, the story walks us through Alice’s life: her hobbies, home, family, and brings us along for the ride when her father goes missing. As the story progresses, we slowly learn slightly ominous details about the situation: her fathers works for an oil company (was he kidnapped?). Alice’s mother is driving very fast at night through a desert (are they running away?). Alice is told to turn her phone off (are they being tracked?). None of these details are fully resolved, as they are learned through Alice’s relatively innocent eyes.
There are many narrative elements we could unpack here, but the interactive elements of the piece are particularly impactful. In order to advance the plot, the reader must click on an arrow. This gives the audience a sense of agency in the story. Although no actual decisions are being made, it feels like you have some control over what is going on.
However, when Alice’s mother tells her to turn off her phone in the middle of the night as they are searching for her father, the interactivity stops, and we lose that feeling of control. The story advances on its own, and we’re left to watch it unfold. Alice’s helplessness in that moment is coupled perfectly with the reader’s lack of control. This lets us empathize with Alice far more. We not only see that Alice is scared and helpless, we feel it too. In this way, Inanimate Alice masterfully uses of interactivity as a genuine literary element.</p>

              <h3><a href="text.html">Everybody Dies</a></h3>
              <p class="post__intro">
              Everybody Dies by Jim Munroe is a texted based adventure you download and can play on your computer. Each stage is a bit of a mystery because based on the scenario you have to figure out which commands will do something useful and interesting. Generally you are able to move with “go”, look around with “look” and grab objects with “take”. Throughout the game the user will control multiple characters and experience a brief snippet of each of their lives, the very end portion. Yet the game does not end upon the death of any character, after a brief waiting time  the player inhabits another employee of Cost Cutters. Allowing users to control the characters with text entry makes them feel as if they are really a part of the story, rather than just an onlooker. Especially at first, it is very possible to believe the commands a reader enters could actually change the outcome of the narrative. Maybe if the user chooses to go east, instead of  heading in any other direction, the character could actually be saved. However, the more time spent playing a run through of Everybody Dies, and especially upon multiple times playing, this illusion of control starts to fall apart. There is only ever one command which will actually make the story move forward, and it can be very difficult to figure out exactly what that command is. While this struggle to find the command can certainly be infuriating, it can be oddly constructive as well. Rather than just blindly following the story, the user has to think through all the different choices a character could make and why they would or would not work in the scenario. Going through this process makes sitting and pondering what to do for 15 minutes not just tolerable, but oddly enjoyable. So while this text entry may not allow a user to actually change the outcome of the story, it does make sure they are actively engaging with the narrative and really thinking about it.

              <h3><a href="text.html">RedRidingHood</a></h3>
              <p class="post__intro">
              RedRidingHood by Donna Leishman is a choose-your-own adventure type of interactive that runs within the web browser. The reader watches a girl who poses as RedRidingHood was given the role to go to a relatives home. On the journey to this place, she encounters a man that has wolf-like aspects and some interaction occurs between them. She continues her adventure and encounters a field of flowers. These flowers seem to be a sedative and she passes out. At this point the user has the option to wake her up or let her dream. These two options eventually lead to the same conclusion. Waking up Red, causes the story to go to another cutscene where the wolf-like man kidnaps or makes Red’s relative disappear while she is sleeping and he takes spot on the bed. When Red arrives at the house, she is raped by the wolf and seems to become pregnant with the wolf-like man’s baby and then the story is concluded by a man murdering her while she is sleeping and still pregnant. The story has the same conclusion even if reader continues to let Red dream.
 	            The scenes within RedRidingHood do not have any dialogue; however, there is audio in the form of background music. Within the scenes, the reader has the ability to hover the mouse cursor over various aspects of the scene itself. For example, the introduction has a cutscene of a city skyline and the reader can hover over the various windows which highlights the window but there is only one window that the reader can click that progresses the story. This simple selection seemingly symbolizes an illusion of control because even though the reader can hover over the different windows highlighting them. Throughout the story, you can only control the actions of Red but not Red herself and to progress through the story the reader has to click on certain things within the scene itself. Through this level of interactivity, Leishman masterfully masks the extent to which the reader exhibits control within RedRidingHood.

              <h3><a href="text.html">Twelve Blue</a></h3>
              <p class="post__intro">
                Electronic literature takes many forms in order to convey its purpose. While some contain complex navigational structures such as clicking through images and travelling through a story as an animated character, others utilize simple yet direct navigational structures such as hypertext to describe a story or a message on an equivalent scale. Twelve Blue by Michael Joyce exemplifies the latter, simplified portrayal of significance. The more notable aspect of this particular electronic piece is its interactivity and its ability to allow the readers to contribute to its meaning. Even with the literature’s restriction on  the amount of overall control, the illusion of any control through the hypertext and images, allow the readers to stay engaged, for their mouse clicks results on a different outcome each time.
Here, Twelve Blue tells a very complex story about life events including but not limited to love affairs, drowning, friendship, and murder. The electronic literature utilizes hypertext and images to convey and continue the story. Sometimes, hypertext is embedded within a section of text. However, often, when there is not, one can navigate by clicking on different sections of the rectangle on the left. Overall, the author allows the reader to take control, however he does not complete control. Illusion of control is evident, for the reader only has a certain number of links to choose from. Within the body of text, only one hypertext is embedded. While this is true, the reader has the choice to change the story drastically by clicking on a random section of the left-hand rectangle. The ability to change one or more aspects of the story allows the readers to feel like they have power and are engaged until the very end.
