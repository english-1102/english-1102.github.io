  Basically, when a reader flips a page in a traditional piece of literature they know they are going directly to the very next part of the story. Conversely, a hyperlink could literally take the reader anywhere on the <a href=""> internet </a>. As mentioned before, in Twelve Blue, this could entail the transition from a love story to a murder mystery. This means the reader must first take stock of where they end up and think critically about how it relates to where they were, then, they will still be left wondering where else they could have ended up because they have no true way of knowing unless they go back and try it. Furthermore, each time a user encounters a hyperlink it serves as a check in point that they are still engaged with the piece. Hyperlinks also offer no visual representation of where they are taking a reader, which engages the aforementioned <a href="intro5.html"> curiosity </a> of readers. While simple hyperlinks are effective, involvement can be further enhanced through the use of more <a href="intro7.html"> advanced interactive methodologies </a> which modern day technology affords.
