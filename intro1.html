  However, a user may not have as much control over a story as they initially believe. If a choice is given over two parallel paths a number of times, the number of possible endings increases exponentially. A human programmer, however, will never be able to represent all of these possibilities. Thus, the author must limit the outcomes in order for the piece to end. When users fiddle with an electronic work long enough, this restriction on the number of attainable story routes becomes evident.

  In the story Inanimate Alice, everything leading up to the climax involves the reader clicking through to advance the story, but the climax itself has no interaction: the story just plays without any user input. This lack of control the reader feels is mirrored perfectly by the lack of control felt by the protagonist as she searches for her lost father. This isn't just some metaphor lost on the casual reader, it's an experience shared by all readers along with Alice herself. This is the power of interactive symbolism: it isn’t just written on a page, it’s <a href="intro2.html">fundamentally involved</a> with the reader.

  Similarly, RedRidingHood by Donna Leishman shows another perfect example of the lack of control within a story. The interactivity is a symbolic tool just as it is in Inanimate Alice. For example, the cutscene in the introduction which portrays buildings with black windows demonstrates this illusion of control. At first, all the visible windows are black, except for one. When hovering over the black windows, they turn yellow. Yet, clicking these windows will not initiate any action. Only clicking on the window that is already yellow will trigger a response and a transition to the next scene. The illusion of choice is demonstrated by  offering the user a veritable sea of windows which they can physically mouse over while only actually allowing them to look into one predefined window, rather than any one they happen to choose. The choice the reader makes to click on the window is really no choice at all, but simply the path that author had already intended for the reader.
