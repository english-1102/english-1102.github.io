      RedRidingHood by Donna Leishman is a choose-your-own adventure type of interactive story that runs within the web browser. The reader watches a girl who poses as RedRidingHood make her way to a relative's home. On the journey to this place, she encounters a man that has wolf-like aspects and some interaction occurs between them. She continues her adventure and encounters a field of flowers. These flowers seem to be a sedative and she passes out. At this point, the user has the option to wake her up or let her dream. Waking up Red causes the story to go to another cutscene where the wolf-like man makes Red’s relative disappear while she is sleeping. The wolf-like man replaces Red’s relative’s spot on the bed. When Red arrives at the house, she is raped by the wolf and seems to become pregnant with the wolf-like man’s baby. Finally the story is concluded by a man murdering her while she is sleeping and still pregnant. Despite the two earlier options initially seeming to branch the story out in different directions, the same ending occurs even if the user chooses to let Red sleep. This eventual convergence perfectly displays how even the illusion of control can be effective. A user will still wonder what might have happened had they chosen the other option, even though in the end it actually makes no difference.

  Within the scenes, the reader has the ability to hover the mouse cursor over various aspects of the scene itself. For example, the introduction has a cutscene of a city skyline and the reader can hover over the various windows and highlight them but there is only one prelit window which actually progresses the story. This simple selection symbolizes another illusion of control because even though the reader actually only has one option, even though it initially seems as if they have lots. Throughout the story, a reader can only control the actions of Red but not Red herself, and to progress through the story the reader has to click on certain things within the scene. Through this level of interactivity, Leishman masterfully masks the extent to which the reader exhibits control within RedRidingHood.
