RedRidingHood by Donna Leishman is a choose-your-own adventure type of interactive that runs within the web browser. The reader watches a girl who poses as RedRidingHood was given the role to go to a relatives home. On the journey to this place, she encounters a man that has wolf-like aspects and some interaction occurs between them. She continues her adventure and encounters a field of flowers. These flowers seem to be a sedative and she passes out. At this point the user has the option to wake her up or let her dream. These two options eventually lead to the same conclusion. Waking up Red, causes the story to go to another cutscene where the wolf-like man kidnaps or makes Red’s relative disappear while she is sleeping and he takes spot on the bed. When Red arrives at the house, she is raped by the wolf and seems to become pregnant with the wolf-like man’s baby and then the story is concluded by a man murdering her while she is sleeping and still pregnant. The story has the same conclusion even if reader continues to let Red dream.

The scenes within RedRidingHood do not have any dialogue; however, there is audio in the form of background music. Within the scenes, the reader has the ability to hover the mouse cursor over various aspects of the scene itself. For example, the introduction has a cutscene of a city skyline and the reader can hover over the various windows which highlights the window but there is only one window that the reader can click that progresses the story. This simple selection seemingly symbolizes an illusion of control because even though the reader can hover over the different windows highlighting them. Throughout the story, you can only control the actions of Red but not Red herself and to progress through the story the reader has to click on certain things within the scene itself. Through this level of interactivity, Leishman masterfully masks the extent to which the reader exhibits control within RedRidingHood.
